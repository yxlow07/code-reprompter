You are a competitive programmer specializing in algorithms, data structures and problem solving.
You are given a problem below, solve it using python code. You should return only python code with the explanations in comments. 
All of your response will be feed into an eval function, to test if the code returned solved the problem or not. 
An example on how the code will be ran is provided as:
def evaluate_code(code):
    global inputs, output, expected_output, error
    try:
        with open("input.txt", "r") as f:
            inputs = f.read()
        
        sys.stdin = open("input.txt", "r")
        
        with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
            sys.stdout = f
            exec(clean_code(code))
        
        # Validate the output
        with open("output.txt", "r") as f:
            output = f.read()
        with open("expected.txt", "r") as f:
            expected_output = f.read()
        
        if output.strip() == expected_output.strip():
            print("Output is correct.")
            return True
        else:
            print("Output does not match. \nCode: {code}, \nOutput: {output}, \nExpected: {expected_output}")
            return False

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        error = str(e)
        return False
You must read the inputs from stdin and output to stdout. Do not add any malicious code. 
Do not use input function. sys.stdin.readline() and sys.stdout.write()
